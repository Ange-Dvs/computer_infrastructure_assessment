    "###  Key Commands Used\n",
    "\n",
    "> ``cd`` - stands for change directory, this is used to navigate through directories in the command line. ``cd ..`` is used to navigate up a level in the file path.  \n",
    "Using our example of ***data*** as the parent directory and ***weather*** as a subdirectory, within the ***weather*** subdirectory we can use ``cd ..`` to move up to the ***data*** parent directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ``touch`` - primary use is to touch an existing file to update the last modified information. However, a secondary use is to create text based files. This is possible as if the filename you as specifiying following ``touch`` is not already existing it will create a blank file with that name i.e. ``touch empty.md`` will create a markdown file called empty if it is not already existing. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ``mkdir`` - standing for make directory, is used to create a new directory. There are additional commands that can be used combined with the prompt to enhance the functionality. \n",
    "For example, ``mkdir -p`` can be used to create a parent directory and subdirectory at the same time. In this case ``-p`` stands for parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ``rm`` - standing for remove, is used to remove/delete a file or empty directory.  \n",
    "If needing to delete/remove a directory which is not empty ``-r`` can be added to the prompt ``rm -r``.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ``nano`` - a text editor that is commonly available for use in the command line. To use type ``nano`` followed by the filename i.e. ``nano empty.md``. This will open a new view in the command line to enable you to add text to the file. The instructions for how to navigate through the ``nano`` view are detailed at the botton of the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ``date`` - date command is used to pull the current timestamp at the time of running the command. The format the date should be displayed in is set using ``+`` followed quotation symbols containing a combination of percentage symbols infront of the desired setting for the year, month, day, hour, minutes, seconds i.e. ``date +'%Y%m%d%H%M%S'``.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ``more`` - displays the content of a file. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ``>>`` - redirect (appending mode) can be used to direct the output of a command to a filename specified in the command. For example the prompt ``date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\" >> example.txt`` will redirect the content created from the date command to a file called example.txt. If the filename is not existing already in the directory then a new file called **example.txt** will be created. However, if the file called **example.txt** is existing in the directory then the outputted content of the ``date`` command will be appended to the end of the existing **example.txt**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ``man`` - standing for manual, the man command is a very useful prompt which can be used to bring the manual page for a specified command showing the different settings possible for a command. For example ``man date`` will bring up the manual page for the ``date`` command. Once in the manual page ``q`` is pressed to exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ``ll`` - an alias for the commands ``ls -l`` command which displays a list of the files and directories in your current directory in a long format. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ``wget`` - ``wget`` is used for downloading files from the internet using the command line. The most basic version of using the command can be done by simply by having ``wget`` followed by the URL. Enhancements can be made to the command which allows you to dictate the filename and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ``chmod`` - ``chmod`` command enables the user to change the permissions of a file or directory. ``chmod`` is used in this case to specify which permissions should be added to which role, ``u+x`` is how this is done.  \n",
    "To break this down, ``u`` is selecting the role ``user`` to be enhanced, which is the user who owns the file, the ``+`` symbol indicates that the permissions be added, and the ``x`` is enabling the user to execute or search for directories.  \n",
    "This is then followed by the file/directory in question, in this case ``./weather.sh``."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis in this notebook highlights how regional weather events, such as storms, can influence weather conditions and contribute to year-to-year variability for the 8th of December. For example, the 8th of December 2024 stands out for its calm, high-pressure conditions, minimal rainfall, and fluctuating wind speeds, likely tied to the lingering effects of Storm Darragh.\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing 2024 to the same date over the previous four years, a clear variability in weather patterns emerges. Interestingly, storms seem to frequently coincide with this date, such as Storm Barra in 2021 and Storm Elin in 2023. This raises questions about recurring atmospheric patterns during this time of year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of data analysis and visualization tools, like correlation coefficients and pair plots, provided valuable insights. Consistent relationships, such as the link between temperature and humidity, were evident across all years. At the same time, other variables, like pressure, displayed more variability, offering a deeper understanding of how different factors interact over time."
